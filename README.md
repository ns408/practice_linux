# practice_linux

Collection of notes to share and practice Linux Administration / Systems Engineering related concepts with my team.

Practice based on Pro Linux System Administration book and other resources.

# Abbreviations

- FOSS - Free and Open Source Software
- GNU - GNU's not Unix, which makes the term a recursive acronym, or an acronym in which one of the letters stands for the acronym itself
- GPL - General Public License

Plethora of Linux Distributions: https://distrowatch.com/

Flavours I'm going to focus on are RedHat and Debian based. In the past, I was a big fan of:
- CentOS and RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)
- Debian and Ubuntu

But things have changed now since CentOS has come to an end. More on this at https://www.zdnet.com/article/centos-linux-8-is-about-to-die-what-do-you-do-next/.

Based on my awareness, I'd pick [Rocky Linux] over [CentOS Stream].
